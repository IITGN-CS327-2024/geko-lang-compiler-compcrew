# Lexer
The lexical analyzer plays a crucial role in processing the source code of a program. It identifies and categorizes tokens, such as keywords and identifiers, and stores them in a symbol table for reference. Additionally, it eliminates white spaces and comments to streamline the code. The analyzer helps in associating error messages with specific locations in the source code, aiding in debugging. It can also expand macros found in the source program and reads input characters to facilitate further processing during the compilation or interpretation of the program. Essentially, the lexical analyzer ensures the effective understanding and preparation of the program for subsequent stages of compilation or execution.
## Running Instructions
1. Download the 'lexer' folder and open it on terminal.
2. Run the command ```$python3 tokens.py <.geko file>``` on terminal to get the output (tokenised form of the code) on the terminal.
