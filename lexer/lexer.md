# Lexer
The lexical analyzer plays a crucial role in processing the source code of a program. It identifies and categorizes tokens, such as keywords and identifiers, and stores them in a symbol table for reference. Additionally, it eliminates white spaces and comments to streamline the code. The analyzer helps in associating error messages with specific locations in the source code, aiding in debugging. It can also expand macros found in the source program and reads input characters to facilitate further processing during the compilation or interpretation of the program. Essentially, the lexical analyzer ensures the effective understanding and preparation of the program for subsequent stages of compilation or execution.
## Running Instructions
1. Download the 'lexer' folder and open it on terminal.
2. Run the command ```$python3 tokens.py <.geko file>``` on terminal to get the output (tokenised form of the code) on the terminal.
## Different Regular Languages Used
### Please Note that this has been updated with respect to the previous one.
|Class|Description|RegEx|Comment on RegEx|
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
|KEYWORD|This class stores reserved words in a programming language that have predefined meanings in the programming language.|``` num \| str \| flag \| fix \| show \| iter \| list \| tup \| enter \| yield \| let \| in \| void \| while \| repeat \| given \| other \| otherwise \| define \| test \| pop \| arrest \| main \| length \| head \| tail \| isEmpty \| append \| skip \| stop \| yay \| nay ```|-|
|MAIN|This token class stores the entry point of a program. Cannot be defined differently. Has to be preceded by keyword num.|```main```|-|
|IDENTIFIER|This class stores names given to variables, functions, etc.|```[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*```|[a-zA-Z0-9_]* signifies that zero or more combinations of underscore, lowercase letter, uppercase letter, digit or underscore can come after the first letter. [a-zA-Z_] signifies that no number can come as the first character of a variable. |
|PARENTHESIS|Used to demarcate scope, and define lists, arrays, and tuples.|```[\[\]{}()]```|-|
|NUM_LITERAL|Defined as any number in between -1023 and +1024 (tentative).|```-?\b\d+\b```|Also takes into account negative numbers with “-?”. “\d+” matches one or more digits.|
|COMMENT|A comment in our language, Geko, is defined by two simultaneous octothorpe (hashtag) symbols consecutively. This consists of a single line comment. Multi-line comments are not defined for Geko.|```##.*```|Checks for two ## at the beginning. Anything after these two symbols, until end-of-line character,  is considered as a comment and discarded by the compiler.|
|STRING_LITERAL| Bounded by two tilde signs. Anything inside two tilde signs, except a newline character,  is considered as a string literal.|```~(?:[^~\\]\|\\.)*~```|Checks for the bounds of two tilde signs. Any character that is not a tilde (~) or a backslash (\)will be considered as a given string literal. Also escape characters are allowed with a backslash.|
|SEPARATOR| Classifies three specific separators in a given input string.|```;\|:\|,```|Checks for either a semicolon, a colon, or a comma. It will match any of these three characters individually.|
|COMPARISON_OPERATOR|Geko supports equal_to, not_equal_to, less_than_or_equal_to, greater_than_or_equal_to, greater_than, and less_than comparisons. The following regular expression checks the same.|```==\|!=\|<=\|>=\|>\|<```|-|
|ASSIGNMENT_OPERATOR|Variables can be assigned values in various ways: conventional “assign” i.e “=” character assigns the left side what is written on the right side of it. “/=” divides the left variable by the RHS value and assigns it to the LHS variable. Similarly, the “+=”, “-=”, and “*=”  assignment operators add, subtract, and multiply the RHS value to the LHS value. The “%=” assignment operator takes the modulo of the LHS value w.r.t the RHS value, and stores it in the LHS variable.|```=\|/=\|\*=\|\+=\|-=\|%=```|These operators are also called **Compound assignment operators**.|
|UNARY_OPERATOR|These operators operate on a single operand.|``` \+\+\|--\|` ```|Union of all the operators that Geko uses as Unary. The ` negates the boolean value.|
|BINARY_OPERATOR|This class represents binary operators commonly used in programming languages which are exponentiation (**), division (/), multiplication (*), addition (+), subtraction (-), and modulus (%).|``` \*\*\|/\|\*\|\+\|-\|% ```|It is the union of all the above mentioned binary operators. Here, ** occurs before * to ensure Maximal Munch while reading tokens.|
|LOGICAL_OPERATOR|This class contains the operators that are often used in boolean and bitwise operations to manipulate and evaluate conditions in programming.|```&&\|\|\|\|&\|\\|\|!\|\^```|It is the union of all the logical operators that Geko uses. Here && and \|\| are given preference over & and \| respectively to follow Maximal Munch.|
|TILDE|This class is to represent the tilde character which represents the string delimiter.|```~```|To separate tilde from the string token.|
