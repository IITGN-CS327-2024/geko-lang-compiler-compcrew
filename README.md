## LEXER:

- The lexer file is named as lexer.py, and all the tescases are also nested under the testcases folder.
- Each test file has the .geko extension, unique to our Geko language.
- Peek into lexer.py for more information on how lexer.py works.

NOTE: For viewing the updated version, please go into the "lexer" folder, and have a look at the README file for instructions on how to run our lexer.
